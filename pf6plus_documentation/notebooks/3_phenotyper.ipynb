    "# Phenotyper\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you to use the **Phenotyper** tool to infer drug-resistant phenotypes from your own data. After inferring the phenotypes, you can use our simple visualisation tools to explore your results and compare them with our **Pf6+** dataset, which stores over 13,500 samples, collected across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see `https://gitlab.internal.sanger.ac.uk/dt5/phenotyper` to explore the complete documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use?** If your Genetic Report Card (GRC) doesn't have information regarding resistant phenotypes or you would like to update previous inferred phenotypes, you can use phenotyper to evaluate a set of rules to infer drug resistance states. Note that any file with information on the genotypes described below, can be used to infer the drug-resistant phenotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Usage: ./phenotyper.r [options]\n",
    "Evaluates a set of phenotyping rules on all the samples of the given data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "        --datafile=DATAFILE\n",
    "                Path to the data file, a tabular file with the required fields (first column reserverd for sample names).\n",
    "\n",
    "        --rulesfile=RULESFILE\n",
    "                Path to the JSON file that encodes the rules to be used for evaluating each drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "        --ruleout=RULEOUT\n",
    "                The field to be extracted from a rule when evaluated as true. Helps with debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "        --samplefield=SAMPLEFIELD\n",
    "                The field on the data file that designates the sample id (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "        --verbose\n",
    "                A flag to obtain verbose detailed output in the standard output (can generate very big logs, for tracebacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "        --output=OUTPUT\n",
    "                Base path for the output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -h, --help\n",
    "                Show this help message and exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which are the required fields for `--datafile` ?** You will need a tabulated file with the following fields: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "crt_76[K]       crt_72-76[CVMNK]        dhfr_51[N]      dhfr_59[C]      dhfr_108[S]     dhfr_164[I]     dhps_437[G]     dhps_540[K]     dhps_581[A]     dhps_613[A]     k13_class       k13_alleles     mdr1_dup_call   pm2_dup_call    gch1_dup_call \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see there is no need for your file to include any further metadata such as location; given that the **phenotyper** only uses genetic data for the inference. Just make sure that you have keep sample_ids from our output file, so you can cross-reference it with other metadata you might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the complete file used can be found on our example file `mygrc_metadata_nophenotypes.tsv`. If you have your GRC, this tool will create this file for you, before moving on to the phenotype prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "**What can I do with the output?** An easy way to visualise your results, is by using `2_prevalence_DR.ipynb`; where you can also compare your data against Pf6+ (a public resource which combines information on over 13,000 samples worldwide), increasing the power of your data.  \n"

    "Better to protect field names with backticks (`) in the JSON file as you'll find weird characters there (for instance they come from Excel files) that will cause havoc in R. One can also do this programmatically by providing a character protection mapping (within the code but not recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The software interprets the rules executing the interpretable R code given in evaluation with some custom-made operators, like %==%, which means loose equality (symmetric any operation, any(a in b) or any(b in a)), to ease the evaluation. When dealing with this kind of task one usually writes a little parser for the operations allowed so no arbitrary code is evaluated. However, as we had to deal with different and changing formatting encodings (e.g. the way hets or missing calls are represented) the prototype evaluates any valid R expression given in the rules. We overwrite R system call functions to prevent attempts of code injection but this is obviously something to bear in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are metarules that check the output status of a previously executed rule by referencing the name of the drug with @, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "           {\n",
    "               \"name\":\"Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-3\",\n",
    "               \"change\":\"Missing\",\n",
    "               \"evaluation\":\"@Artemisinin@ %contains% 'Missing' || @Piperaquine@ %contains% 'Missing'\",\n",
    "               \"interpretation\":\"Undetermined/Missing\",\n",
    "               \"phenotype\":\"Missing\",\n",
    "               \"analytics\":\"Undetermined\"\n",
    "            },\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can run the program in --verbose mode and save the log. The file will be huge (and the execution is very slow), but I use it to trace back which rules were executed and why when phenotypes changed or were weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Important things to bear in mind \n",
    "1. For each drug we define a set of rules that are executed sequentially.\n",
    "2. **Order is important** (top-down execution until finding one that evaluates to true).\n",
    "3. There should be always a default catch-up rule at the end (it will be executed if nothing else has been executed. A default rule just evaluates to `True` or `T`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "           {\n",
    "               \"name\":\"Chloroquine-5\",\n",
    "               \"change\":\"76-nonT\",\n",
    "               \"evaluation\":\"T\",\n",
    "               \"interpretation\":\"Unknown mutant\",\n",
    "               \"phenotype\":\"Undetermined/unknown\",\n",
    "               \"analytics\":\"Undetermined\"\n",
    "            }\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. The script will evaluate each rule according to the `evaluation` field (required).\n",
    "5. The output that will be obtained from a rule that evaluated to true must be specified using the `--ruleout` option. This allows for different outputs even when working with the same set of rules. Example: in our current phenotyping rules we made some arbitrary decisions (samples with het resistance markers are considered undetermined instead of resistant, you can imagine a different world where hets are resistant or dominant hets are resistant). However, one can check what difference these decisions make with the same set of rules by providing different output fields and indicating so when calling the program. For instance, using `--ruleout het_phenotype` instead of `--ruleout phenotype` (see example rule definition below)\n",
